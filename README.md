# File Uploader(Google Drive Clone)

## Project Description

This project is a stripped-down version of Google Drive, implemented as a web application. It demonstrates key features of a personal cloud storage service, including user authentication, file management, and folder organization. The application showcases modern web development practices and utilizes a robust tech stack for building scalable and secure web applications.

## Key Features

- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system using Passport.js
- File Management: Upload, download, and view file details
- Folder Organization: Create, read, update, and delete folders
- Session Management: Persistent sessions using Prisma Session Store
- Database Integration: Efficient data storage and retrieval with Prisma ORM
- Cloud Storage: File storage using Cloudinary or Supabase (optional)

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma
- Authentication: Passport.js
- Session Management: express-session with Prisma Session Store
- File Handling: Multer
- Frontend Templating: EJS (or your chosen frontend framework)
- (Optional) Cloud Storage: Cloudinary or Supabase

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the `.env` file with your database URL
4. Run database migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
5. Start the server: `npm start`

## Future Enhancements

- Implement file sharing functionality
- Add user roles and permissions
- Integrate real-time collaboration features
- Improve UI/UX with a modern frontend framework
